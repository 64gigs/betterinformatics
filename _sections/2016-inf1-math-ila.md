-   **Tip from a (current) 3rd year**: the maths exams are also open
    book, so I'd recommend taking in past papers with solutions as they
    reuse questions a lot. They might not necessarily be the same, but
    they'll likely be close enough to give you a hand.

-   **The Exam** - 3 hours - Open Book
    <br>Section A: 40% - 6 questions - conceptual questions, a bit like Tophat
    <br>Section B: 60% - 4 questions (pick 3) - longer, conceptual questions
    <br>You may bring:
    -   the Poole textbook
    -   any non-graphical calculator
