-   **Allocations**: [tutorials], [labs]
-   **Labs**
    - There is nothing to submit.
    - You only need to fill out the online form at the end of the week to record your progress.
-   **[Tutorials](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1/op/tutorials.html)** (read this document!)
    - These start on week 2. Labs start week one.
    - There are exactly [two tutorials] taking place in every time slot. You do not need to stick to the same room each week.
      - 1.B09 for the Fundamental tutorial
      - 1.B10 for the Advanced tutorial
    - _[Which tutorial should I go to?](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf1/op/tutorial-list.html)_
-   **Exam**
    - The exam is 2 hours. It used to be 3 hours in previous years. They will not pressure you for time, don't worry.
    - There is a mock exam in week 11.
    - All code must compile for ANY credit at all. If you miss a single semicolon, you get 0 marks. Trip-check if it compiles and is the right file before submitting!
    - Your code must also pass the very basic tests (JUnit tests, these will be provided in the exam for you to check) to get any credit at all.
-   There is no required book, but the recommended book **The Java Tutorial: A Short Course on the Basics, Addison-Wesley** is (as mentioned under the Books header of the course page) [accessible online]. It is also in the library (on paper & online).
