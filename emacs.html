THIS IS ONLY FOR FIXING "haskell has died"


First we need to get the location of the ghci. In a terminal, type:

which ghci

This will give you something like "/usr/local/bin/ghci". The important bit here is "/usr/local/bin"

Now we need to add this thing to the end of the .emacs file (user file where you're supposed to paste install-haskell.txt)

in emacs:
To do this open Emacs and press the key command M-:, that is, pressing
colon while the Alt key is held. A prompt will appear at the bottom of the screen,
enter (find-file user-init-file) exactly (including parentheses) and press
Enter

(File location is ~/.emacs)


(setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ":/PATH/TO/GHCI/DIRECTORY"))
(setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/PATH/TO/GHCI/DIRECTORY")))

Alt-x

"eval-buffer" enter

Save the stupid file. Restart emacs.

It should work. C-c C-l
