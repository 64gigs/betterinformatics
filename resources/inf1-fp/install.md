This guide walks you through getting your development environment set up for INF1-FP on your computer.

1. Get Homebrew â€” this is a package manager that allows you to install and uninstall software on your computer.

   Do not continue until you have Homebrew installed.
2. **Install Haskell Platform**

   Open up **Terminal.app** and type the following command: `brew cask install haskell-platform`, and press Enter.
   
   This command will install Haskell Platform (the Haskell environment) for you on your computer. It will prompt you
   for your administrator password, so do not walk away just yet.
3. **Install Visual Studio Code**

   In the terminal, type the following command: `brew cask install visual-studio-code`, and press Enter.
   
   This is the code editor we recommend you to use. You should now have "Visual Studio Code.app" in your Applications folder.
4. **Get the _Haskero_ extension**

   Haskero is the extension we will use to improve Haskell support in Visual Studio Code.

   - Open up Visual Studio Code either by selecting it in the Applications folder, or by typing `code` in the terminal.
   - Click the "squares" icon in the sidebar. This should open up the "Extensions" pane.
   - Type "Haskero" in the search field, and press Enter.
   - Click "Install" on the search result. Click "Yes" if it asks to install dependencies.
   - Click the "Reload" button to reload the current window (this will start the Haskero extension)
